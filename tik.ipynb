thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets\\nand made verona\\'s ancient citizens\\ncast by their grave-beseeming ornaments\\nto wield old partisans in hands as old,\\ncankered with peace, to part your

adversary,\\nand yours, close fighting ere i did approach.\\ni drew to part them. in the instant came\\nthe fiery tybalt with his sword prepared,\\nwhich, as he breathed defiance to my ears,\\nhe swung about his head and cut the winds,\\nwho, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn.\\nwhile we were interchanging thrusts and blows\\ncame more and more and fought on part and part,\\ntill the prince came, who parted either part.\\n\\nlady montague\\no, where is romeo? saw you him today?\\nright glad i am he was not at this fray.\\n\\nbenvolio\\nmadam, an hour before the worshiped sun\\npeered forth the golden window of the east,\\na troubled mind drove me to walk abroad,\\nwhere underneath the grove of sycamore\\nthat westward rooteth from this city side,\\nso early walking did i see your son.\\ntowards him i made, but he was \\'ware of me\\nand stole into the covert of the wood.\\ni, measuring his affections by my own\\n(which then most sought where most might not be\\nfound,\\nbeing one too many by my weary self),\\npursued my humor, not pursuing his,\\nand gladly shunned who gladly fled from me.\\n\\nmontague\\nmany a morning hath he there been seen,\\nwith tears augmenting the fresh morning\\'s dew,\\nadding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.\\nbut all so soon as the all-cheering sun\\nshould in the farthest east begin to draw\\nthe shady curtains from aurora\\'s bed,\\naway from light steals home my heavy son\\nand private in his chamber pens himself,\\nshuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,\\nand makes himself an artificial night.\\nblack and portentous must this humor prove,\\nunless good counsel may the cause remove.\\n\\nbenvolio\\nmy noble uncle, do you know the cause?\\n\\nmontague\\ni neither know it nor can learn of him.\\n\\nbenvolio\\nhave you importuned him by any means?\\n\\nmontague\\nboth by myself and many other friends.\\nbut he, his own affections\\' counselor,\\nis to himself--i will not say how true,\\nbut to himself so secret and so close,\\nso far from sounding and discovery,\\nas is the bud bit with an envious worm\\nere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air\\nor dedicate his beauty to the same.\\ncould we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,\\nwe would as willingly give cure as know.\\n\\n[enter romeo.]\\n\\n\\nbenvolio\\nsee where he comes. so please you, step aside.\\ni\\'ll know his grievance or be much denied.\\n\\nmontague\\ni would thou wert so happy by thy stay\\nto hear true shrift.--come, madam, let\\'s away.\\n[montague and lady montague exit.]\\n\\nbenvolio\\ngood morrow, cousin.\\n\\nromeo  is the day so young?\\n\\nbenvolio\\nbut new struck nine.\\n\\nromeo  ay me, sad hours seem long.\\nwas that my father that went hence so fast?\\n\\nbenvolio\\nit was. what sadness lengthens romeo\\'s hours?\\n\\nromeo\\nnot having that which, having, makes them short.\\n\\nbenvolio  in love?\\n\\nromeo  out--\\n\\nbenvolio  of love?\\n\\nromeo\\nout of her favor where i am in love.\\n\\nbenvolio\\nalas that love, so gentle in his view,\\nshould be so tyrannous and rough in proof!\\n\\nromeo\\nalas that love, whose view is muffled still,\\nshould without eyes see pathways to his will!\\nwhere shall we dine?--o me! what fray was here?\\nyet tell me not, for i have heard it all.\\nhere\\'s much to do with hate, but more with love.\\nwhy then, o brawling love, o loving hate,\\no anything of nothing first create!\\no heavy lightness, serious vanity,\\nmisshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,\\nfeather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,\\nstill-waking sleep that is not what it is!\\nthis love feel i, that feel no love in this.\\ndost thou not laugh?\\n\\nbenvolio  no, coz, i rather weep.\\n\\nromeo\\ngood heart, at what?\\n\\nbenvolio  at thy good heart\\'s oppression.\\n\\nromeo  why, such is love\\'s transgression.\\ngriefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,\\nwhich thou wilt propagate to have it pressed\\nwith more of thine. this love that thou hast shown\\ndoth add more grief to too much of mine own.\\nlove is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;\\nbeing purged, a fire sparkling in lovers\\' eyes;\\nbeing vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.\\nwhat is it else? a madness most discreet,\\na choking gall, and a preserving sweet.\\nfarewell, my coz.\\n\\nbenvolio  soft, i will go along.\\nan if you leave me so, you do me wrong.\\n\\nromeo\\ntut, i have lost myself. i am not here.\\nthis is not romeo. he\\'s some other where.\\n\\nbenvolio\\ntell me in sadness, who is that you love?\\n\\nromeo  what, shall i groan and tell thee?\\n\\nbenvolio\\ngroan? why, no. but sadly tell me who.\\n\\nromeo\\na sick man in sadness makes his will--\\na word ill urged to

right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.\\n\\nromeo\\nwell in that hit you miss. she\\'ll not be hit\\nwith cupid\\'s arrow. she hath dian\\'s wit,\\nand, in strong proof of chastity well armed,\\nfrom love\\'s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed.\\nshe will not stay the siege of loving terms,\\nnor bide th\\' encounter of assailing eyes,\\nnor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.\\no, she is rich in beauty, only poor\\nthat, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.\\n\\nbenvolio\\nthen she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?\\n\\nromeo\\nshe hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;\\nfor beauty, starved with her severity,\\ncuts beauty off from all posterity.\\nshe is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,\\nto merit bliss by making me despair.\\nshe hath
